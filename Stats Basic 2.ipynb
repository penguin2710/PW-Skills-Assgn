The mean is the average obtained by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. It is sensitive to extreme values and provides a representative value of the entire dataset. The median is the middle value when the data is ordered, and it is less affected by outliers. It represents the value that divides the dataset into two equal halves. The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It highlights the most common value or values. These measures complement each other and provide different perspectives on the central tendency, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset."

Additionally, the presence of the outlier increases the range from 45 to 45.5, and it impacts the variance and standard deviation, resulting in larger values."
