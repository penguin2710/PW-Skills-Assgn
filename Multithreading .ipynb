    "Advantages of multithreading include improved performance through concurrency and parallel execution, enhanced responsiveness by preventing blocking of the user interface, efficient resource sharing among threads, and modular design for better code organization. However, multithreading introduces complexity, requiring careful coordination and synchronization to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. It can also lead to resource contentions and increased memory overhead. Additionally, the benefits of multithreading may be limited by diminishing returns on CPU scaling. Overall, multithreading offers significant benefits in terms of performance and responsiveness, but it requires careful consideration and management of its complexities and potential drawbacks."

    "Deadlocks: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a state of deadlock where none of them can proceed.
