    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It offers a minimalist approach to web development, providing only essential tools and features. With its simplicity, Flask allows developers to have more control and customization over their applications. It has a shallow learning curve, making it easy for beginners to get started quickly. Flask also has a large and active community, offering extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party extensions. Overall, Flask's advantages lie in its simplicity, flexibility, ease of use, and the strong support it receives from the Python community."

    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL routes and associating them with corresponding functions or views in a Flask application. It involves mapping specific URLs to specific functions that will handle the requests and generate responses. App routes are used to define the different endpoints or pages of a web application. By using app routes, we can specify the desired behavior of our application based on the incoming URL. This enables us to create a logical structure for our application, handle different types of requests (GET, POST, etc.), and provide appropriate responses to the users based on their interactions with the application."
